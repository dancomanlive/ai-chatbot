## Guest User Rate Limiting

This template includes a comprehensive guest user rate limiting system that encourages users to subscribe after trying the service:

### Features
- **Cookie-based Session Management**: Guest users are tracked across chat sessions using persistent cookies
- **Message Count Tracking**: Accumulates message count across different chat conversations
- **Subscription Popup**: Automatically triggers after 3 messages to prompt guest users to create an account
- **Cross-tab Persistence**: Rate limiting works across multiple browser tabs and page refreshes

### How It Works
1. **Guest User Creation**: When a user visits without authentication, a guest user is created automatically
2. **Cookie Persistence**: Three cookies track the guest session:
   - `guest-user-id`: Unique identifier for the guest user
   - `guest-user-type`: Always set to "guest"
   - `guest-message-count`: Running count of messages sent
3. **Rate Limiting**: After 3 messages, the 4th message attempt returns a 429 status with subscription prompt
4. **Session Reuse**: Returning guests reuse their existing session and message count

### Security Considerations
The current implementation provides reasonable protection against casual bypass attempts:

**✅ Protected Against:**
- Opening new tabs in the same browser
- Page refreshes
- Starting new chat conversations
- Closing and reopening the browser (within cookie expiry)

**⚠️ Can Be Bypassed By:**
- Using incognito/private browsing mode
- Switching to different browsers
- Clearing browser cookies/data
- Using different devices

For stricter rate limiting, consider implementing IP-based restrictions or requiring email verification for guest users.

### Configuration
Guest user limits are configured in `/lib/ai/entitlements.ts`:
```typescript
export const entitlementsByUserType = {
  guest: {
    maxMessagesPerDay: 3,
    // ... other limits
  },
  // ... other user types
};
```

## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET&envDescription=Learn+more+about+how+to+get+the+API+Keys+for+the+application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=AI+Chatbot&demo-description=An+Open-Source+AI+Chatbot+Template+Built+With+Next.js+and+the+AI+SDK+by+Vercel.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22grok%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22xai%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22upstash-kv%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22upstash%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22blob%22%7D%5D)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
